#This project utilizes a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)

#Select the customer account numbers for all the order that were placed in February. 
SELECT DISTINCT customers.acctnum, FebSales.orderID, FebSales.Product
